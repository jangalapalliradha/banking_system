# Bank Account

You're designing a simple banking system that handles operations on bank accounts. The system should be capable of the following features:
- input banking transactions
- calculate interest
- printing account statement

All the example below assumes console input/output is used. 


When launching the application, it prompts user for actions:
```
Welcome to Awesome Bank! What would you like to do?
[T] Input transactions 
[I] Define interest rules
[P] Print statement
[Q] Quit
>
```
